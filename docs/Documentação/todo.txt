As you can tell from the agenda
(http://www.celigent.com/omg/umlrtf/docs/agendas/U2WG_Agenda.htm) posted on
the web, we expect the June 12 meeting to be dominated by work sessions
related to the RFP draft. At present there is only one prepared presentation
expected: "Recommendations to Improve the architecture of UML, MOF and XMI",
presented by Steve Cook and Stuart Kent. If anyone else would like to
schedule an appropriate prepared presentation, please let us know asap.
